# lang-hs
## (Still coming up with a good name)

A language with semantic set-theoretic types, algebraic effects, and a minimal,
Haskell-inspired syntax.

This project is under development, and a functional product will not be
available for some time.

Contributions welcome!


## TODO:
### (Mostly everything right now)
- Parser
- AST-transformation passes
- Implement missing features in type system (records, row polymorphism, parametric polymorphism)
- Decide whether or not to include certain features (macros)
- Control-flow-graph generation
- Static-analysis based memory management
- LLVM code generation
- Tooling (CLI, REPL, LSP server, formatter)
